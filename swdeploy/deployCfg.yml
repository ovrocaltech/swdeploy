# Example YAML config used by deploy service running on each host. Typically,
# a single host is configured to repspond to a single cmd. Here, this example
# shows it responding to 2 cmds, gpu and wx. Each command represents 0 or more
# repos and services that the host should deploy and restart respectively.
# Each repo must have a script named deploy which contains instructions to
# build if necessary and install the code. The service, should be a systemd
# service which is handled via systemd's systemctl command. The deploy script
# should handle inserting systemd service files into /etc/systemd/system/
# setup.
# The service will listen for the command(s) sepecified in this file and the
# payload will be the version of the shell repo to checkout. It will checkout
# the specified shell version and
# change directory into each of the defined 'repo' listed and run the deploy
# script. When all repos have been deployed, it will restart each service
# in the 'service' list using 'systemctl restart <service>'.
#
# The web ui will contain 2 buttons. 'update', 'deploy'. The update button
# will fetch the shell repo and repopulate the vesions drop-down as well as
# fill in the current version deployed and the prev. version deployed. The
# user can then select a version to deploy and hit the 'deploy' button.
#
# A table will show the status of each host as it reports its progress.
